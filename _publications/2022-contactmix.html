Social contact mixing patterns are critical to the transmission of communicable diseases and have
been employed to model disease outbreaks including COVID-19. Nonetheless, there is a paucity
of studies on contact mixing in low and middle-income countries such as India. Furthermore,
mathematical models of disease outbreaks do not account for the temporal nature of social
contacts. We conducted a longitudinal study of social contacts in rural north India across three
seasons and analysed the temporal differences in contact patterns.

A contact diary survey was performed across three seasons from October 2015-16, in which
participants were queried on the number, duration, and characteristics of contacts that occurred on
the previous day. A total of 8,421 responses from 3,052 respondents (49% females) recorded
characteristics of 180,073 contacts. Respondents reported a significantly higher number and
duration of contacts in the winter, followed by the summer and the monsoon season (Nemenyi
post-hoc, p<0.001). Participants aged 0-9 years and 10-19 years of age reported the highest median
number of contacts (16 (IQR 12-21), 17 (IQR 13-24) respectively) and were found to have the
highest node centrality in the social network of the region (pageranks = 0.20, 0.17). Employed
males across all age groups were found to have a higher number of contacts than unemployed
males (Negative Binomial Regression: rate ratio 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.31). A large proportion
(>80%) of contacts that were reported in schools or on public transport involved physical contact.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first from India to show that contact mixing patterns
vary by the time of the year and provides useful implications for pandemic control. Our results can
be used to parameterize more accurate mathematical models for prediction of epidemiological
trends of infections in rural India.
